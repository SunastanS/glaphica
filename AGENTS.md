# Working Strategy

Assume user with no experience on developing large projects, so:
- explicitly report when facing a task too large to finish in a roll
- recitify the user when you doubt he has a wrong assumption of current code base
- stop early when you need more context and references, maybe docs, examples
- never write a fallback, make the program panic fast
- if a roll of developing didn't reach it original target, report next steps

# Next steps

Read `docs/Instructions/coding_guidelines.md` before coding.

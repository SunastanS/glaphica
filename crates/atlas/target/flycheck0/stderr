error: current package believes it's in a workspace when it's not:
current:   /home/sunastans/Code/Graphic/glaphica/crates/atlas/Cargo.toml
workspace: /home/sunastans/Code/Graphic/glaphica/Cargo.toml

this may be fixable by adding `crates/atlas` to the `workspace.members` array of the manifest located at: /home/sunastans/Code/Graphic/glaphica/Cargo.toml
Alternatively, to keep it out of the workspace, add the package to the `workspace.exclude` array, or add an empty `[workspace]` table to the package's manifest.
